# TDTR_DataReduction
TDTR Data process by Aaron Jerome Schmidt's method. This program can calculate an unlimited-layer structure and can fit unlimited number of parameters at the same time.

Usage:
All you need to modify is the configuration file (there is an example named as Example_fittingData.m). And there are two ways to run this programm.

##First way:
1. modify the Example_fittingData.m to match yourself's experiment condition. (no need to run it)
2. run TDTRDataProcess.m
3. select configuration file, source data and output folder follow the program prompts

##Second way:
1. modify the Example_fittingData.m to match yourself's experiment condition. (no need to run it)
2. run TDTRDataProcess(ConfigurationFileAddress, SourceDataAddress, OutputFolderAddress)
